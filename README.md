# microwire

## WIP - This is work in Progress - DO NOT USE

microwire intends to extends go-micro with wire generated code, its intended to merge microwire into go-micro.dev/v5.

## Goals

- Backward compatiblity is not required at all places but a nice to have
- Replace [util/cmd](https://github.com/go-micro/go-micro/tree/master/util/cmd)
- Choose what features you want from go-micro:
  - You can select if you want Auth/Events/"name it here"
  - If you don't want CLI opts you can exclude them
  - No default plugins, that makes the core even slimer
- Choose your Prefix for CLI opts not only "micro"
- No more Globals, everything lives in the DI
- wire for the end users will allow them wire theier app together
- Easy to make a micro Service and a monolith with the same codebase

## Implemented features

- 4 components without util/cmd (will have all)
- Cli is a component now, its easy to replace it with other flag+env plugins
- ArgPrefix("myapp") for micro flags and environment vars
- NoFlags() option, this will disable all micro flags
- 3 stages of building the ConfigStore
  - 1: Load the compiled in config
  - 2: Overwrite it with config from sources, for example "file" (given by flags/env)
    - Auto detects the file extension, if you give "config" it will look for both "config.yaml" and "config.toml"
  - 3: Overwrite it with env/flags.

## Example yaml config

```yaml
